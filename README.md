# GodzamokXtreme

**GodzamokXtreme** is a mod for [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) that automates the building selling process for use with the **Godzamok** spirit in the Temple minigame. It allows players to efficiently trigger the **Devastation** buff by selling and optionally rebuying buildings, with full control over how the process works.
